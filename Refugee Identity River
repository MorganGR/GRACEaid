  Introduction
  
  The effort on this document is completely on a voluntary basis in order to discover, validate and experiment with one of the most
  critical BUT secondary humanitarian issues regarding displaced population.
  We must note that basic needs are always the primary most critical point and these include sustenance, shelter, sanitation.
  
  The aim is to initiate the discussion regarding what is feasible and cost effective.
  I propose we follow the humanitarian grass roots movement motto of:
  "Dignity, Humanity, Equality and Freedom"
